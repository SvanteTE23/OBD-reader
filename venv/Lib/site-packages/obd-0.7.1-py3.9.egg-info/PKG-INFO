Description: python-OBD-wifi
        ==========
        
        A python module for handling realtime sensor data from OBD-II vehicle
        ports. It is derived from the python-OBD repo for serial data. This is an adaption for ELM327 Wifi compatible modules.
        
        
        ```
        
        Basic Usage
        -----------
        
        ```Python
        import obd
        
        connection = obd.OBD("192.168.0.10", 35000) # connect to specific OBD-II-wifi Adapter. In our case it is a Panda by comma.ai
        
        cmd = obd.commands.SPEED # select an OBD command (sensor)
        
        response = connection.query(cmd) # send the command, and parse the response
        
        print(response.value) # returns unit-bearing values thanks to Pint
        print(response.value.to("mph")) # user-friendly unit conversions
        ```
